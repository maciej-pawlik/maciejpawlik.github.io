# About

## Biography

Maciej Pawlik is an interdisciplinary disaster scientist specialising in disaster resilience, disaster risk reduction, and human–nature interactions. He is currently a part-time PhD candidate at University College London (UCL).

He holds a BSc in Clinical Psychology (2021) and an MSc in Global Futures (2022) from Royal Holloway, University of London.

## Research Philosophy

He is helping to shape disaster science as an interdisciplinary stand-alone discipline. His PhD research is focused on nature-based disaster resilience, exploring ways that people learn about nature-based solutions across resilient cities like Glasgow and Kyoto. Through a better understanding of learning processes in this context, Maciej seeks to develop learning interventions and immersive storytelling as powerful tools to deepen disaster science understanding and drive meaningful behavioural change in the face of environmental threats. His research approach is creative and is informed by posthumanist thinking, establishing the need for knowledge gained to be applicable to the realties faced by vulnerable people, to achieve true resilience.

## Current Roles 

Beyond his PhD, Maciej works full time in HE professional services to fund his studies. At UCL he teaches on the Emergency Planning & Management PGT module, as well as on the Disaster & Climate Justice PGT module. He maintains a position on several UCL committees (Dept. EDI, Student-Staff; Faculty Student-Staff), while also serving as a Climate Ambassador for London, supporting schools in developing climate action plans and mentoring young students. Aside from university committments, Maciej is a Steering Committee Member of the UK Alliance for Disaster Research (UKADR), which places him at the heart of discussions about national disaster research and policy coordination.
